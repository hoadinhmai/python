1. Add the ability to “reboot” instances.
2. Add a “—force” flag to the “instances stop”, “start”, “snapshot”, and
“reboot” commands.
a. If “—project” isn’t set, exit the command immediately with an
error message, unless “—force” is set.
3. Add a “—profile” option to the “cli” group, which let’s you specify a
different profile.
e.g. “shotty —profile Kyle instances stop —force”


1. Use a try/except block to catch “botocore.exceptions.ClientError”
when creating snapshots, and print an error message.
2. Add an “instance” argument to the appropriate commands, so
they only target one instance.
e.g. “shotty volumes list —instance=i-0123456789abcdef”
3. After a snapshot, only start instances that were running before
the snapshot was taken


1. Add an optional “age” parameter to the “snapshot” command that
takes an age in days and only snapshots volumes whose last
successful snapshot is older than that many days.
e.g. “shotty instances snapshot —age 7 —project Valkyrie”
2. When snapshotting, don’t stop an instance unless the script will
snapshot one of its volumes.
3. Add a “region” parameter to all commands that will let the user
override the region set in their AWS CLI configuration profile.
e.g. “shotty —region us-east-1 instances list”
